# W.O.P.R. Display

W.O.P.R Display is a modern take on the W.O.P.R. missile launch sequence from the 1983 movie War Games.

I love the movie War Games - It was one of my first glimpses into computers and how they could be connected, and I thought that the W.O.P.R. computer in the movie was amazing, with all of it's flashing LEDs and computer noises.

But most of all, I loved the intense missile unlock sequence in the movie. W.O.P.R. guessing the unlock code, while Matthew Broderick tries to teach it that no one ever wins. It was exciting and I always wanted to make a "replica" of that unlock sequence... and I finally did!
